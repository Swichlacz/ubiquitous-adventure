   #Nature I
   **by Ralph Waldo Emerson**
   
    _Winters_ know
    Easily to shed the snow,
    And the untaught _Spring_ is wise
    In cowslips and anemonies.
    Nature, hating art and pains,
    Baulks and baffles plotting brains;
    Casualty and Surprise
    Are the apples of her eyes;
    But she dearly loves the poor,
    And, by marvel of her own,
    Strikes the loud pretender down.
    For Nature listens in the rose
    And hearkens in the berry's bell
    To help her friends, to plague her foes,
    And like wise God she judges well.
    Yet doth much her love excel
    To the souls that never fell,
    To swains that live in happiness
    And do well because they please,
    Who walk in ways that are unfamed,
    And feats achieve before they're named.
