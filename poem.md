   ## Nature I
   > by Ralph Waldo Emerson
   
   _Winters_ know<br>
   Easily to shed the snow,<br>
   And the untaught _Spring_ is wise<br>
   In cowslips and anemonies.<br>
   Nature, hating art and pains,<br>
   Baulks and baffles plotting brains;<br>
   Casualty and Surprise<br>
   Are the apples of her eyes;<br>
   But she dearly loves the poor,<br>
   And, by marvel of her own,<br>
   Strikes the loud pretender down.<br>
   For Nature listens in the rose<br>
   And hearkens in the berry's bell<br>
   To help her friends, to plague her foes,<br>
   And like wise God she judges well.<br>
   Yet doth much her love excel<br>
   To the souls that never fell,<br>
   To swains that live in happiness<br>
   And do well because they please,<br>
   Who walk in ways that are unfamed,<br>
   And feats achieve before they're named.<br
